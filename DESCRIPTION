Description: A prediction-based approach to the analysis of data from
    randomized clinical trials is implemented. Based on response and
    covariate data from a randomized clinical trial comparing a new
    experimental treatment E versus a control C, the objective is to
    develop and internally validate a model that can identify subjects
    likely to benefit from E rather than C. Currently,
    survival and binary response types are permitted.
